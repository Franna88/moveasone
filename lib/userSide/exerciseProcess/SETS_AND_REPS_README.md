enhanced.EnhancedWorkoutStarter.startEnhancedWorkout(
  context,
  workoutData,
);
```

### Workout Data Structure

```dart
Map<String, dynamic> workoutData = {
  'name': 'Strength Training',
  'description': 'Full body workout',
  'warmUps': [
    {
      'name': 'Dynamic Warm-up',
      'sets': 1,
      'reps': 10,
      'duration': 60,
      'isTimeBased': true,
      'restBetweenSets': 15,
    }
  ],
  'workouts': [
    {
      'name': 'Push-ups',
      'sets': 3,
      'reps': 12,
      'isTimeBased': false,
      'restBetweenSets': 60,
    },
    {
      'name': 'Plank',
      'sets': 3,
      'reps': 1,
      'duration': 30,
      'isTimeBased': true,

  ]
};
```

### Exercise Configuration

Each exercise supports the following properties:

| Property | Type | Description | Default |
|----------|------|-------------|---------|
| `name` | String | Exercise name | Required |
| `sets` | int | Number of sets | 1 |
| `reps` | int | Repetitions per set | 1 |
| `duration` | int | Duration in seconds (for time-based) | 30 |
| `isTimeBased` | bool | Whether exercise is time-based | false |
| `restBetweenSets` | int | Rest time between sets (seconds) | 30 |
| `description` | String | Exercise instructions | '' |
| `videoUrl` | String | Video demonstration URL | '' |
| `audioUrl` | String | Audio guidance URL | '' |
| `imageUrl` | String | Exercise image URL | '' |

## Demo Usage

Access the demo from the Workout Flow Demo screen:

1. Navigate to the workout demo area
2. Tap "üèãÔ∏è Enhanced Sets & Reps Demo"
3. Experience the full workout flow with:
   - 1 Dynamic warm-up exercise
   - 5 Strength training exercises with varied sets/reps

## Integration Examples

### Basic Integration

```dart
// In your workout start button
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    enhanced.EnhancedWorkoutStarter.startEnhancedWorkout(
      context,
      myWorkoutData,
    );
  },
  child: Text('Start Workout'),
)
```

### Custom Exercise Screen

```dart
EnhancedExerciseScreen(
  exerciseData: {
    'name': 'Push-ups',
    'sets': 3,
    'reps': 12,
    'restBetweenSets': 60,
    'isTimeBased': false,
    'setTotal': '3',
    'repsTotal': '12',
  },
  onComplete: () {
    // Move to next exercise
  },
  onStatusUpdate: (status) {
    print('Exercise status: $status');
  },
)
```

## State Management

The system automatically manages:

- **Current Set**: Which set the user is currently performing
- **Completed Sets**: How many sets have been finished
- **Rest State**: Whether the user is in a rest period
- **Exercise Progress**: Overall progress through the workout
- **Phase Tracking**: Current workout phase (warm-up/workout/cool-down)

## Visual Design

### Color Coding
- **Purple**: Current/active set
- **Green**: Completed sets/exercises
- **Blue**: Rest periods
- **Orange**: Optional actions (skip rest)
- **Grey**: Inactive/upcoming sets

### Animations
- **Pulse Animation**: Current set indicator pulses to draw attention
- **Progress Animation**: Smooth progress bar updates
- **Completion Animation**: Celebration effects when sets are completed

## Error Handling

The system gracefully handles:
- Missing or invalid media URLs
- Malformed exercise data
- Network connectivity issues
- User navigation interruptions

## Performance Considerations

- **Efficient Animations**: Uses hardware-accelerated animations
- **Memory Management**: Properly disposes of video/audio players
- **Lazy Loading**: Media is loaded only when needed
- **State Cleanup**: Automatic timer cleanup on component disposal

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:
- **Weight Tracking**: Log weights used for exercises
- **Rep Counting**: Automatic rep detection via device sensors
- **Voice Commands**: Hands-free set completion
- **Progress Analytics**: Detailed workout statistics
- **Social Features**: Share workout achievements

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Sets not progressing?**
- Ensure `setTotal` and `repsTotal` are properly set as strings
- Check that `onExerciseComplete` callback is provided

**Rest timer not working?**
- Verify `restBetweenSets` is set as a number (not string)
- Check that Timer is properly initialized

**Media not playing?**
- Ensure URLs are valid and accessible
- Check internet connectivity
- Verify media format compatibility
